# DC-Motor Control

This project focuses on modeling and controlling a DC motor using MATLAB and Simulink. It demonstrates two different approaches to system modeling and evaluates the performance of a PI controller.

## Features

**Physical Model:**

A first-principles model of a DC motor implemented in Simulink. Captures the dynamics of the motor including voltage, current, torque, and speed.

**Black-Box Model (PT-1):**

System identification of the DC motor using a first-order transfer function (PT-1). Parameters are optimized using fminsearch for the best fit.

**Controller Design:**

A PI controller is designed and tuned for the physical model. The controller performance is evaluated.

**Educational Insight:**

This project provides an intuitive understanding of system modeling and control using a simple yet practical example. It demonstrates one possible workflow from model development to controller design.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/hirschlersim/DC-Motor-Controll
```
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project folder.
3. Execute the main live script to run the simulations and analyses:
```
main.mlx
```
4. View the results and plots generated by the simulations.
